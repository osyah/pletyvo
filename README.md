# Introduction

## Network

A network is a set of rules and platform components that are defined and managed by the owners or creators of the network. Each network is an independent part that acts in its own interests, giving the network owners complete freedom (it is worth noting that when using cloud or other provider services, certain restrictions may be imposed due to laws or requirements of some countries).

The network is created through the registry protocol, after which the network receives its own identifier and the ability to interact with other registry networks. Common standards and protocols enable the use of a single application for multiple networks, avoiding the need to install multiple applications or create accounts.
